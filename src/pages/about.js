      <p>I've spent the last 10 years in the Art world. I have a master's degree in Art Business and have worked as as a specialist/cataloger for Rare Books and Works on Paper. I started to understand that there was a ceiling in terms of how much I could continue to learn and grow in the industry, and felt this was a great time to pivot and find something new that was both challenging and came with more choices for the future. A friend had attended Grace Hopper and highly recommended it. I began coding by learning Python on an app and enjoyed it - I found myself exceeding my daily time goal of coding as I enjoyed the process of puzzling out answers. I was drawn to Grace Hopper by their mission in increasing representation in tech and bringing more voices to the table. I'm excited to continue my coding journey!</p>
